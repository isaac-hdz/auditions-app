<!-- these are HTML notes -->

<!-- Websites are like human bodies.
      HTML is like the skeleton. It's the building blocks that shape the site.
      CSS is like the skin hair. It's what makes the site look pretty.
      JavaScript is like the muscles and nervous system. It's what makes the site move.

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- this goes at the top of an HTML file -->
<html lang="en">

  <!-- the head section is used for setting metadata -->
  <head> 
    <!-- like the character set -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- or the title that shows up on the tab of your browser -->
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <!-- or width settings for different device sizes -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <!-- or importing stylesheets -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../stylesheets/main.css">
    <!-- or importing scripts -->
    <script src="../javascript/main.js"></script>
  </head>

  <!-- HTML elements can open and close, or open/close in one -->
  <!-- 
    <div> <-- open
      <p>Some text</p>
      <p>Some more text</p>
    </div> <-- the slash "/" shows that we're closing it
    
    You could technically do everything above like: <div><p>Some text</p><p>Some more text</p></div>
    It's the same HTML, but with the white space its easier to read:
      1. The extra lines make it easy because the different elements are separated by lines (when possible)
      2. The indentation makes it easier to see what is inside the div and where it closes.
