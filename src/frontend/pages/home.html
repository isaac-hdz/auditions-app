<!-- these are HTML notes -->

<!-- Websites are like human bodies.
      HTML is like the skeleton. It's the building blocks that shape the site.
      CSS is like the skin hair. It's what makes the site look pretty.
      JavaScript is like the muscles and nervous system. It's what makes the site move.

      What the fuck is jQuery?
        jQuery is a JavaScript library.
      
      What is a JavaScript library?
        Well, vanilla (basic) JavaScript can get tedious to write. JavaScript libraries are more JavaScript
        code, where someone else has done the difficult work with vanilla JS to create new functions that
        are simpler to use.

      But what does jQuery make easier?
        jQuery is for UI/frontend work. It makes it easier to pick/find HTML elements (by class, id, any attribute
        on the HTML element), and then do something to or with that element.

        Example:
          * $('.c1').on('click', function() { /* do something */ }); // Does somthing whenever any element with class "c1" is clicked
          * $('#i1').click(); // simulates a mouse click on the element with id "i1"
      
      jQuery is used in a lot of places (I think). We're only going to spend like 30m on it though. Because React
      is more important.

      So today, we'll recreate what is in src/frontend/javascript/main.js, but we'll do it on this page.

  <!-- HTML elements can open and close, or open/close in one -->
  <!-- 
    <div> <-- open
      <p>Some text</p>
      <p>Some more text</p>
    </div> <-- the slash "/" shows that we're closing it
    
    You could technically do everything above like: <div><p>Some text</p><p>Some more text</p></div>
    It's the same HTML, but with the white space its easier to read:
      1. The extra lines make it easy because the different elements are separated by lines (when possible)
      2. The indentation makes it easier to see what is inside the div and where it closes.

  <!-- the body is where the content goes -->
  <body>
    <!-- a div is a section in html -->
    <div>
      <!-- h1, h2, h3 are different header types (of different sizes, boldness, etc.) -->
      <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
      <!-- p is for text -->
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    <!-- hr is for a horizontal line -->
    <hr>

    <!-- body, div, p, h1, hr, etc. are all "elements" -->

    <!-- class is to categorize certain elements so that you can style them or add js rules to all of them together -->

        console.log('This is happening!');
        e.target.innerHTML = "<div>CHANGED!</div>";
