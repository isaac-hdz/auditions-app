# auditions-app

An app for actor's to keep track of their auditions.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To clone the app onto your computer run:
```
git clone https://github.com/isaac-hdz/auditions-app.git
```

### Running Locally

To get the frontend/UI running locally, just run:
```
yarn dev:ui:[os]
```
Where `[os]` is substituted with your OS. Example: `yarn dev:ui:mac`

Check package.json to see which OS have a script already created for them. If your OS is not there, feel free to add a new script.

All this script really does is open the entry point (home page) in the default browser.
